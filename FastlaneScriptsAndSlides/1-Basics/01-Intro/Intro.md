# Intro
Hey, what’s up everybody, this is Brian. Welcome to our course on fastlane for iOS. 
<!-- Briefly introduce fastlane, then segue immediately to our framing characters -->
**[ Slide 1 ]**
Fastlane is an amazing suite of tools built to automate and streamline the otherwise tedious and repetitive tasks iOS developers traditionally have had to perform manually on the Apple App Store. 
In this course, you’ll discover how you can use fastlane in your and your team’s daily workflows. And you’ll  learn through exercises and challenges how fastlane can save you valuable time, avoid mountains of grunt work, and streamline many of the gnarliest aspects of iOS development. 
<!-- Introduce fastlane better. 
It's open source, MIT. -->
We’ll dive into those details in a moment. But first, I’d like to introduce a couple of characters we’ll meet repeatedly throughout this course.
## The Characters
**[Slide 2]**
Meet **Devon**. Devon’s an iOS developer. She’s talented, motivated, and mostly really loves what she does. She has a new dog training app — called **Chew Chew Train** in the App Store, which you’ll learn more about a bit later on. 
Chew Chew Train is doing nicely, so Devon is adding new developers and testers to her team, and starting to extend her app for additional devices and locales.  She’s also discovered a real love for puppies, and so she’s just adopted one of her very own, named **Freebo**. 
## The Problem
**[Slide 3]**
Devon and Freebo fell in love at first sight, and Devon usually can’t wait to finish work so she can play with her new best friend. But increasingly, there’s a problem: As she grows her app and her business, Devon is finding that dealing with the App Store is getting more and more complicated. 
**[Slide 4]**
Different developers have conflicting certificates; test users have a hard time getting registered for app versions; screenshots take forever to create and submit, and surprisingly often, there’s some small problem that requires her to resubmit everything. And all this has a way of happening right at the point when she least has time for it. 
Devon has less and less time for development. Even worse — at least from Freebo’s perspective — Devon has less and less time for her new puppy. it seems like every time she wants to get away and take Freebo out for a walk, some issue with the App Store requires her immediate attention. 
From Freebo’s perspective, “optimizing App Store interactions” isn’t some abstract concept. He’s embarrassed to admit it, but he really has to take a wee. Devon feeling a lot of anxiety over time being wasted too (though thankfully, she doesn’t have to widdle). Development is losing a lot of its fun, and Devon knows she has to find a better way… and soon.
## The Solution
**[Slide 5]**
Happily, Freebo discovers our course (well, ok, Devon discovers it while Freebo tries to chew her new iPad). This is the tool she needs, and she’s ready to dive in and put it to use.
Throughout this course, we’ll revisit Devon and Freebo from time to see how switching to fastlane affects their lives. (Spoiler alert: there’ll be a lot of smiles and wagging tails in their near futures).
<!-- If we want a teaser, this might not be a bad place for one. Possibly to show cert in action? -->
## Next
Now that you’ve met Devon and Freebo, in the next episode we’ll take a closer look at some of the main challenges we all face as we interact with the App Store manually, without fastlane. See you there…
