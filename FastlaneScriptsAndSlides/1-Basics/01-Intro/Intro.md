# Intro
```swift
//7 seconds
```
Hey, what’s up everybody, this is Brian. Welcome to our course on fastlane for iOS. 
## About Fastlane
```swift
// 55 seconds
```
Fastlane is an amazing tool that’s designed to automate and streamline the tedious and repetitive tasks iOS developers have traditionally had to do manually as we publish our apps to the Apple App Store. 
As you’ll learn in this course, fastlane provides a series of tools that can automate and profoundly streamline virtually every part of this process.
Each of these tools is powerful on its own. But best of all, they work together in “lanes” that multiply the power of each individual tool. And you can customize all of this to best suit your own project needs and style. 
As you’ll soon see, fastlane is quite powerful indeed. It’s no exaggeration to say that it can truly transform your life as an iOS developer. Once you see for yourself how much time, effort and human error it can save you, you may never want to work without it!
## Let’s Get Started
```swift
//20 seconds
```
In this first section of the course, we’ll introduce fastlane itself. You’ll get a good sense of what this tool is and how to use some of its core tools. And you’ll dive right in as you put fastlane to immediate use with our sample project. Let’s get started!
