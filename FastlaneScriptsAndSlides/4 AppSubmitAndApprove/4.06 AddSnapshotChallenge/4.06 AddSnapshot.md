# Introduction
In this episode, it's your turn to integrate `snapshot` directly into your sample project.  
# Introducing the Challenge
Your challenge this time is a bit more complex than you're previous ones, and I think you'll like it:
## Basic Challenge
You'll start by integrating `snapshot` into our sample project, as you saw me demo in the last episode. Again the main steps are:
- Add a UI Test Target named `FastlaneSnapshots`
- Run `snapshot init` 
- Add ./SnapshotHelper.swift file to your project and the `FastlaneSnapshots` target 
- In `FastlaneSnapshots.swift`, remove the boilerplate code
	- Give the setUp() method these 3 steps (point to slide)
	- Add a new testSnapshot() method. Inside this, record a walkthrough of each app screen, and then insert calls to snapshot() to initiate each screenshot.
Then, update your Fastfile to include `snapshot` by expanding your existing `check_metadata` lane. Rename this to `release` and after your current `preceheck` step, add a call to `snapshot`.
Don't worry if you don't remember everything we demoed in the last episode — a big reason for these challenges is that we learn differently when we code ourselves. If you get stuck, feel free to review this section of the previous episode as you're doing this if you need a refresher on the steps we used.
## Advanced Challenge
<!-- Should we have pre-added localizations ready? -->
Here's your advanced challenge: 
First, you'll create a separate snapshot schema, so that your real UITests and Snapshot are in completely separate buckets. Here are the steps for this:
- In Xcode, create a new "Snapshot" scheme and link it to your `FastlaneSnapshots` target.
- Then edit your new Scheme. In the Edit Scheme modal, choose the Build action and tick `Run` to enable it. Remember to close the modal to save your changes.
Second, you'll edit your newly-created `Snapfile` Ruby configuration file in your Fastlane subdirectory. Remember that you can refer to the `snapshot` documentation page for examples, and that any lane parameter can be used in your Snapfile. Update the file so that it does the following:
- Select your new "Snapshot" scheme.
- Remove all previous screenshots on each run.
- Stop immediately if an error occurs.
- Create screenshots for US English and German

OK, you've got your challenge. As usual, please stop the video here and give this a shot. I'll see you when you're done to review everything. Have fun!
# Demo: Challenge Answers
Welcome back. I hope that was fun! Let's go through this step by step, starting as usual with our Basic Challenge:
## Basic Challenge
In Xcode, I create the `FastlaneSnapshots` UI Test Target, making sure I don't choose Unit Tests by mistake. I run `snapshot init`, then  add `SnapshotHelper.swift`to my `FastlaneSnapshots` target. Now I clean up `FastlaneSnapshots.swift` and configure `setUp()` to enable `snapshot`. I add testSnapshot(), record a walkthrough of my 5 views, and app calls to snapshot() where I want snapshots taken. I'll save my changes, and we're done with this part.
Now I open Fastfile. I rename the `check_metadata` lane to `release`, then simply add a call to `snapshot` and save my changes.  I don't know about you, but that seems almost too easy. Thanks fastlane!
## Advanced Challenge
Moving on to our advanced challenge…
I create a new Scheme in Xcode, linking it to my snapshots target. Then I edit it, select the Build scheme, and enable "Run" and close the modal. `snapshot` needs this last bit so it can trigger our actions.
In my Snapfile, I first add
```ruby
scheme("Snapshot")
```
This finishes our steps to completely separate our project snapshot actions from standard UI Tests and makes sure snapshot knows the right scheme to call.
I then add
```ruby
clear_previous_screenshots(true)
stop_after_first_error(true)
```
Finally, I uncomment the languages method call, and set the languages to
```ruby
languages([
  "en-US",
  "de-DE",
])
```
## Trying it Out
To bring this full circle, I'd like you to pause your video here and run your lane. In Terminal, simply run:
```bash
fastlane release
```
This will likely take several minutes, because `snapshot` has some serious lifting to do now on your behalf. Go stretch your legs or grab a cup of joe, and resume when everything's finished. I'll see you then…
# Pause for Action
# Demo
Welcome back again. Let's take a look at our results:
First, in Terminal, `snapshot's` given a nice summary of everything it created for us. It also created and has presented us with a web page showing us all the screenshots created, nicely sorted by language and then by device. (There's a small presentation glitch causing the iPad Pro 12.9 inch standard and third generation screenshots to be incorrectly grouped together. This is solely a local presentation issue, and has no effect on our directory structure or anything we'll do downstream.) 
Meanwhile, in Finder, 2 subfolders - one each for US English and German — each contain sets of screenshots for each possible device. (We could limit devices by uncommenting the devices function call in `Snapfile` if we wanted). Everything's cleanly namespaces and ready for further processing. 
# Conclusion
I hope that gives you a clear sense of how much snapshot can do on your behalf. As a reminder, if you hit any errors, feel free to grab the Completed project for this episode and rerun `fastlane release` with this. 
<!-- Do we have the Starter/Completed project sets here like in books/tuts, or is there a? -->
Up next: We'll learn to automagically frame our newly minted screenshots, optionally add captions, and size them to meet App Store specs.
