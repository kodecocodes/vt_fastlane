# Introduction
Thanks to snapshot, we now have complete sets of screenshots for our app. But since the end game is to create the best possible screenshots for our app, we're not done yet: Now we'll want to put our raw screenshots inside device-specific frames. That's what we'll do in this episode.
# Lecture
## The Hard Way
**[Slide ]** 
Traditionally, placing each screenshot within matching device-specific frameworks isn't technically difficult. It involves either working with a designer or else downloading templates of iOS devices, and then working in an image-processing app like Sketch or Photoshop. Really, this is a repetitive, time-consuming and error prone process, and not a brilliant use of our time.
**[Slide ]** 
Once again, we'll look to fastlane automation to tame this task. The tool we'll reach for this time is `frameit`.  Exactly as its name implies, `frameit`    is designed to wrap device-specific frames around your raw generated screenshots. And it does this with panache.
## Installing ImageMagick
Before you can run `frameit` , you do need to install a helper utility called `ImageMagick`. If you're not familiar with it, `ImageMagick` is a long-time cross-platform command line utility that packs a lot of image processing power. Since you have homebrew installed, installing it's a snap. Simply run 
```bash
brew install imagemagick
```
Go ahead and pause the video and do this now.  I'll wait here :-]

## Command Line
Thanks for doing that now —  it'll make things cleaner downstream. Once Image Magick is installed, working with `frameit` is a snap. Once again, `frameit`'s documentation page, help conventions, and other conventions all follow standard fastlane protocol, so everything about it should feel familiar by now.
There's one gotcha when running `frameit` in the command line: If you run it from the root directory of your project, it will attempt to frame all images in your project folder… not so much what you want. So if you're running this ad hoc in the CLI, just start by switching to your screenshots subdirectory:
```bash
cd fastlane/screenshots
```
From here, everything's as expected. You can frame a set of raw screenshots via the command line as simply as running:
```bash
fastlane frameit 
```
`frameit`  downloads iOS device frames, and then wraps each of our raw screenshots within the appropriate image, intelligently offsetting each image (a painful manual task), as well as by default using the screenshot folder structure created earlier by `snapshot`. Each framed image is inserted with `_framed` appended, and our original screenshots are left intact. 
To frame your screenshots in white instead of black, run
```
fastlane frameit silver
```
Your newly framed images will replace your old ones as you'd expect. As usual, there are more command line options available, and you can check them out via `fastlane frameit -help` as expected.
## Fastlanes
Adding `frameit` to a lane is as simple as clean and simple:
```ruby
lane :my-lane do
  ...

  frameit(path: "./fastlane/screenshots")

  ...
end
```
Note that the path parameter which was missing in the command line is thankfully present here.
For common usage, the only other parameters you're likely to use are color parameters which take boolean values:
```ruby
frameit(rose_gold: true, path: "./fastlane/screenshots")
```
In both the command line and lanes, `frameit` will intelligently fall back to `white` if `rose_gold` or `gold` aren't available for a given device profile.
# interlude
That's the basics of using frameit in the CLI or lanes. However, there's one more important task to cover.
