# Introduction
In this section, you'll learn how fastlane can profoundly automate and streamline submitting your app and its assets to the App Store for approval. 
This is traditionally an especially cumbersome process, which is unfortunate, given how crucial it is to our apps' ultimate success. 
Happily, fastlane offers a suite of actions designed to relieve each of the conventional pain points of this process. 
First, you'll meet `precheck`, fastlane's action that checks all your app metacontent for issues that could get it rejected.
Next, you'll learn how you can automatically create all the screenshots for your app — across all target devices — automatically with fastlane `snapshot`, and then you'll meet `frameit`, which lets you place each image in a beautiful custom device frame.
Finally, you'll meet `deliver`, the workhorse action that handles an extraordinary amount of work and manages the entire process of submitting all these assets to the App Store.
And, of course, you'll continue adding these to your own set of custom lanes. By the end of this section, your lanes will address the full scope of the app development cycle — from initial development, through beta distribution and testing, and finally, to getting your app up on the App Store.
