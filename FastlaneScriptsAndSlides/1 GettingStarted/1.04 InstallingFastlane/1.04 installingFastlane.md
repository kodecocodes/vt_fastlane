# Intro
In this episode you'll install fastlane and initialize it for our course's sample project. Let's dive right in…
# Lecture
## Installing Xcode Command-line Tools
<!-- 
Tim, I'd love to streamline this episode. If you have any thoughts at all, I'm all ears :] 

FWIW, my concern in the XCode CLI Tools is to make sure they've installed the most recent version. Maybe we could skip the Xcode part and just keep this while episode in the CLI? 
-->
Our first step is ensuring Xcode's command line tools are installed and up to date.
Start by opening Xcode, choosing Preferences and selecting the Locations tab. Make sure that `Command Line Tools` is set to your most recent version of Xcode. If it's not, make it so, which will trigger installation of the command line tools. 
By the way, as we walk through each step here, please take the time to complete each step on your own mac. Don't hesitate to pause the video or rewind it as needed. I'll wait :]
Next, open your `Terminal` app. Run the following command:
```bash
xcode-select --print-path
```
So long as you see the path to your most recent copy of `Xcode`, your `Xcode` tools good to go.
## Ruby
**[Slide ]** [https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/][1]
Next, since fastlane runs on `Ruby`. let's confirm your mac's `Ruby` installation. Run
```bash
ruby -v
```
You should get back a message similar to:
```bash
ruby 2.5.3p105 (2018-10-18 revision 65156) [x86_64-darwin18]
```
<!-- I'll complete this section once I get word back from Felix about recommended Ruby version, whether we should have folks install rbenv, etc. One of my biggest concerns is that Ruby issues could trip peeps up, so I want to both keep this quick, but make sure Ruby's good to go from here on. -->
Once again, be sure to pause the video if you need more time.
# Interlude: Homebrew
**[Slide ]** [https://brew.sh]()
Now we'll install `Homebrew`. If you're not familiar with it, `Homebrew` is a fantastic command line utility — also implemented in `Ruby` — that a portal to a vast world of free, open-source languages and command-line developer utilities. We'll use it in throughout this course. 
# Demo: Installing/Verifying Homebrew
Next, we'll make sure Homebrew is installed on your mac:
```bash
brew -v
```
if you don't get a version number back, you'll need to install Homebrew. To do this, run this command. Be sure to press `Enter` when you're prompted:
```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
Now, whether or not you just installed Homebrew, run:
```bash
brew update
brew doctor
```
These commands make sure you're running the most recent version of Homebrew, and that everything's running smoothly. If `brew doctor` reports any issues, go ahead and follow its recommendations to resolve them before continuing.
# Demo: Installing Git
Next, we'll confirm your git installation by running:
```bash
git --version
```
.f you don't get back a version number, run this command to install git:
```bash
brew install git
```
# Demo: Installing fastlane
On to the main event:! Run the following command to install fastlane itself:
```bash
brew cask install fastlane 
```
By the way, if you already had fastlane installed, now is a good time to make sure it's up to date, since it gets updated by the team quite frequently. To do this, simply run:
```bash
fastlane update_fastlane
```
# Interlude: Chew Chew Train
Now that you've installed fastlane and its dependencies, I'll quickly introduce the sample iOS project we'll be using throughout this course. If you haven't already, install the Materials for this course and ……………
<!-- Finish preceding ¶ making sure it complies with RW vid course standards -->
Our sample iOS project is called `Chew Chew Train`. It's a warm-hearted app that takes a fresh spin on dog training. It's central premise is that every dog — and their human — should get a nice treat every time you ask her or him to do anything… regardless of the result. We'll be using this app as our fastlane guinea pig throughout this course. You probably shouldn't use it in real life tho…
# Demo: Initializing fastlane in our project
You've installed fastlane and our sample project. There's one last step to complete: fastlane needs to be initialized for each project since, much like git, it operates on a per-project basis.
In your `Terminal` app, navigate to the project's root directory
```bash
cd <directory path>
```
…and then run:
```bash
fastlane init
```
The `fastlane` initialization script begins by analyzing your project. It then offers you a choice of starting configurations. We'll choose `4-manual`, because we'll be building up everything from scratch. Do this now, and be sure to tap `Enter` when prompted. 
Great! Fastlane is now initialized for your project. Run
```bash
 open .
```
…to open your project in a Finder window. As you can see, there's a new `Gemfile` in your project root directory, containing fastlane configuration settings. But the main payload is the new fastlane folder. 
<!-- open fastlane folder in Finder -->
This folder has been initialized with an `Appfile` and, most importantly, a shiny new `Fastfile`. `Fastfile` will be the star of this show: it's where you'll create all your custom lanes throughout this course.
# Conclusion
Nice work! You've taken care of all the preliminaries, and we're ready to go now. Take a moment to give yourself a well-earned pat on the back (assuming you're more coordinated than I am :) 
In the next episode, we'll start working with fastlane itself. See you there…
