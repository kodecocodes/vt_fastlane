# Intro
In this episode, you'll meet **sigh**, a fastlane action designed to ease and automate the creation and management of provisioning profiles. 
# Lecture
So far, we've looked at two pillars of App Store security: registering an app, and obtaining a valid signing certificate. Now it's time to address provisioning profiles. These can be a source of confusion for many developers.
## Identifying Devices
**[Slide ]** Puzzle piece
Up to now, we've ensured that both we as developer, and our apps can be identified. This gives us a lot, since our apps can be code-signed with our Development Certificates. But it's not enough. Apple also requires that apps run only on devices they're approved for. This, of course, is why users must download apps only from a sanctioned source, typically the App Store.
To achieve this in the Development phase, we must gather the identifiers of all iOS devices we'll run our app on in this phase. With this information in place, we can then request a provisioning profile. 
## The Role of Profiles
Super! But… what exactly is a provisioning profile? 
**[Slide ]** Bond: License to Install?
Essentially, a profile is like a group license authorizing a set of authorized iOS devices to install and run a given iOS app. If a target device is has a profile installed matching both its own device UDID and the app about to be installed, it's all good. If anything's off, the app can't be installed on that device. 
## Types of Profiles
 Profiles come in 4 flavors. Here's a quick overview
### Development Team
**[Slide ]** Development Profiles
Development Profiles address the development phase of an app lifecycle we're focusing on now. Basically, this encompasses in-team development, running in simulator and developer iOS devices. If a device isn't in this list, the in-development app can't be installed or tested on it, period.
### Ad Hoc
**[Slide ]** Ad Hoc Profiles
Ad Hoc Profiles provide a way to distribute an app to a known, finite set of iOS devices outside the App Store. These are typically used to distribute an app to testers via a third party testing service.
### Enterprise
**[Slide ]** Enterprise Profiles
Enterprise Provisioning Profiles provide a way for larger enterprises to distribute in-house applications to enterprise-approved devices. 
### App Store
**[Slide ]** App Store Profiles
Finally, the App Store Profile comes into play when you publish your app for TestFlight or App Store distribution. We'll cover this in more detail in later sections.

## sigh
**[Slide ]** sigh documentation page
`sigh` is both the name of the fastlane action, and a nicely geeky pun referencing the infinite number of sighs historically heard as iOS developers planet-wide struggle to manually maintain provisioning profiles.
Once again, its documentation page is […/actions/sigh][1] and its conventions follow through as expected. As expected, its alias and summary are listed at top, command line usage next, and finally, in-lane usage.
`sigh` is designed to work hand in hand with `cert`, which you met in the last episode. It supports all four types of provisioning profiles and has tools to create, download, renew, and repair profiles. 
# Demo
## Command line
Let's try it out. Once again, basic usage is predictably:
```bash
fastlane sigh
```
I'm prompted for my Apple ID and team as before, and also this time, the bundle ID (aka unique identifier) of my app. This makes sense, as `sigh's` goal is to create a provisioning profile for my specific app. 
`sigh` silently logs into the Developer Portal, fetches my provisioning profiles, checks if any are valid for my bundle ID, gets my Development Certificates from my keychain, sees if any provisioning profiles match these (and if not, creates a new one), then downloads and installs the valid provisioning file. 
Not sure about you, but I really like letting fastlane do this for me :)
OK, let's see what else we can do in the command lane:
```bash
fastlane sigh --help
```
One thing we haven't done yet is to use the --verbose option. I'll do this now and also include info so I'm not prompted
```bash
fastlane sigh -u bschick1@mac.com -l "Brian Schick" -a com.razeware.ChewChewTrain --verbose
```
Now I get a better sense of how it interacts with my keychain.
If I'd like to see all my provisioning profiles, I can use the `manage` command. I'll add the handy `-e` option to automatically clear any expired profiles at the same time:
```bash
fastlane sigh manage -e
```
I could also repair and resign profiles just as easily — see the documentation for more info.
## Lanes
Moving on to in-lane use, I can invoke `sigh` in a lane as simply as:
```ruby
  lane :this_lane_is_my_lane do
    ...
    sigh
  end 
```
This is equivalent to running the simple form in the CLI. However, since lanes are for automation without our intervention, we definitely don't want to be prompted for our info in this context. For now, I'll fix this by adding the appropriate params:
```ruby
  lane :this_lane_is_your_lane do
    sigh(
      username: "bschick1@mac.com",
      team_name: "Brian Schick",
      app_identifier: "com.razeware.ChewChewTrain"
    )
  end 
```
And now this runs silently. Sweet!
# Summary
That wraps up our coverage of sigh. By now, it's clear that each fastlane action follows very consistent patterns, making it easy to quickly grab and use a new one.
In the next episode, it'll be your turn once again, as you'll put `cert` and `sigh` to use in a new custom lane you'll create. I'll see you there…
