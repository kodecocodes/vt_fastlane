# Introduction
Congratulations on completing the second section of this course.
# Lecture
In this section, we've completed our tour of fastlane's actions for the development phase of iOS app development. 
You've learned about fastlane's ambitious and revolutionary approach to team-based code signing. As part of this you've  met your (ahem) `match` and discovered its capabilities, set up a private git repo to hold team credentials, and set up an automation lane that automatically refreshes your team credentials every time it's run. 
You've also learned a good deal more about how best to use fastlane in the command line and in lanes, as well as a lot of new techniques to make your lanes work together better with more power, and with helpful documentation.
And last but definitely not least, you've completed and tuned your lanes for the development phase of iOS development.
# Conclusion
In the next section, we'll turn our focus to the next phase of iOS development: beta testing and test distribution. There's a lot of exciting things in store, and I think you'll really like this. 
See you thereâ€¦
