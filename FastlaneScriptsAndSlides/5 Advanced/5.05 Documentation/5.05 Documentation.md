# Introduction
In this episode, we'll add automatic project documentation to our fastlane workflow.
# Lecture
As we're automating more and more of our developer actions, it makes sense to consider integrating documentation into this scheme. 
As we've already seen with git, unit test, and lint integration, by doing this, we guarantee that it happens every time we build, and no matter which team member is driving. That's especially critical with documentation, since out of date docs are often worse than nothing at all.
## Jazzy
**[Slide ]** Jazzy Logo
We'll leverage another Realm open source tool for this task, a soulful hero that goes by the name of `Jazzy`. `Jazzy` supports Swift and Objective-C too. It's home page is [https://github.com/realm/jazzy][1].
To install jazzy, run:
```ruby
gem install jazzy
```
Now run
```ruby
jazzy -v
```
If you get back a version number you're all set. If not, run these commands:
```ruby
gem uninstall jazzy
```
Respond "y" when prompted
```ruby
sudo gem install -n /usr/local/bin jazzy
```
<!-- 

We're grounded. Although this work-around resolve raw Jazzy installation issues, fastlane's jazzy action doesn't recognize this installation. It then attempts to install a fresh copy of jazzy, which fails because the script includes hard-coded references to old versions of both Xcode and OSX. 

I'll open a line to Felix about this. Worst case, we could run this via a fastlane shell script. Or drop this episodeâ€¦
