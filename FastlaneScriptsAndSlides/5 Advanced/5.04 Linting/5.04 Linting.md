# Introduction
Now that we've integrated source control and unit testing into our lanes, a good next step would be to lint our code while we're at it.

## About Linters
If you're not familiar with code linting, it's a way to sift (or "lint") through a codebase and call out — and optionally auto correct — code that's not formatted to meet a standard. 
**[Slide ]** 
Especially in team development environments, linting is often an essential tool at ensuring that everyone on the team uses the same coding conventions. This can lead to significant boosts in code quality and productivity. 
With linting, the devil's in the details: a linter enforces a configured set of rules, and if it's too strict, or you or your team haven't vetted these, the linter will just get in your way. Taking the time to tune a linter's rule can make the difference between a tool that smacks you upside the head or gently taps you on the shoulder. 
## SwiftLint
**[Slide ]** [https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint][1] + "Watch Your Language"
Fastlane offers built-in support for `SwiftLint`, an open source linter maintained by Realm. It's main GitHub page is at [https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint][2]. It's rules are well-documented at [https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/blob/master/Rules.md][3], with great examples of code that will pass or be flagged by each rule, and rule options. If you implement this yourself, this is a great place to start.
# Demo
To begin, we need to install SwiftLint. I'll use Homebrew:
```bash
brew install swiflint
```
Next, we'll add a SwiftLint configuration file to our project so that we can customize our rules. Like fastlane and homebrew, SwiftLint is written in Ruby, so its configuration file is written in YAML — a common format for Ruby configuration files. I'll start by creating a new `.swiftlint.yml` file in my project root and telling it which directories to check.
We can now run Swiftlane in the command line:
```bash
swiftlint
```
As you can see, it steps through through my project files and issues several warnings, giving me the file, line number, and relevant rule for each. It's not hugely useful yet, but that's a nice start.
