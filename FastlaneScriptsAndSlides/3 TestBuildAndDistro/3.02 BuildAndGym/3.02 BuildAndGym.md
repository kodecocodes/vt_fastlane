# Introduction
The time has arrived: Your app is coming together nicely and you're getting ready to distribute it to testers. The first step of this is creating an Archive build and obtain a certificate for test distribution. As you think the build steps though, your heart sinks just a bit.

## Manual Build Steps
**[Slide ]** 
To start, you need to register all your test devices on the Apple Developer portal. Thankfully, you've already seen how fastlane makes this a simple and automatic process. But that's just the start…
**[Slide ]** 
For every build you want to test, you'll need to manually create an archive. It's easy enough to select a generic device and choose Product \> Archive. But Xcode needs to validate your app, which includes provision checking and much more. And if anything goes wrong, you'll get a dreaded warning and need to manually track down and fix the errors.

Then, you'll move on to Xcode's Organizer window, where you'll need to choose whether you want to distribute your app via Test Flight or a service like HockeyApp, and Xcode will then generate a distribution or ad hoc certificate matching your choice.

Next up, you'll choose a development team and a related developer account. You'll also choose whether the app is Universal or device-specific. You'll also specific any on-demand resources to be uploaded, which includes a potential manifest file for app-thinning. At the end of all this, Xcode will download an essential .ipa file enabling you to distribute your app.

None of this is rocket science. But it *is* cumbersome and time-consuming, and all this point-and-clicking to make manual choices creates opportunities for error, not to mention plain old confusion. Suffice it to say, this isn't a task many of us look forward to.
**[Slide ]** xcodebuild
There has been a traditional alternative for those wanting to avoid this manual process. Xcode's command line tool `xcodebuild` can automate this process. But as you can see, the command's syntax isn't exactly easy to remember, and there's a lot of opportunities for error. Powerful as this option is, I'd guess most developers typically choose the slower Xcode approach over this.
## Introducing Gym
**[Slide ]** 
`gym` is fastlane's tool purpose-built to tame this repetitive manual process. It's built to handle the heavy lifting of this process, from creating your archive to code signing your app for testing.
 And as you'd expect, its documentation pages and operations in the command line and in lanes are all consistent with what you've seen with previous fastlane actions.
Let's take a closer look:
# Exercise
Like other actions you've seen, `gym` can be invoked very simply: 
```bash
fastlane gym
```
Needless to say, this is a whole lot simpler than the `xcodebuild` (although under the hood, `xcodebuild` is one of the core tools `gym` leverages).
