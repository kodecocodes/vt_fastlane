Does this sound familiar? Development of your new iOS App is cruising along smoothly when you slam into a problem with the Developer Portal or App Store Connect. Suddenly, instead of coding, you're sidelined by broken Certificates, Profiles, managing builds and testers, or wrestling with screenshots, metadata and other App Store requirements. There's got to be a better way.
