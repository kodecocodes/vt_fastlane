Does this sound familiar? Development of your Next Great iOS App is cruising along smoothly until… you're derailed by a time-sucking manual task involving the Apple Developer Portal and App Store Connect. Suddenly, instead of coding, you're stuck on the side of the road, finding and fixing broken Certificates or Provisioning Profiles, corralling team Devices or enrolling all your testers and and fixing odd problems building and distributing your test builds. When you're ready to submit your app for distribution, manually creating and customizing screenshots and metadata for all your languages and devices and hoping you don't hit an App Store gotchas sends your blood pressure soaring. There's got to be a better way...

Complete my course to learn how `fastlane` can help you cruise on by these common trouble spots on the road to delivering your iOS apps. You'll learn how to use `fastlane's` deep and rich automation tools to streamline and automate all things related to the Apple Developer Portal and App Store Connect. Even better, I'll show you how to create and share your own powerful `fastlane` scripts to automate your entire iOS workflows from start to finish, saving you and your team mountains of time and letting you rest assured that every process is always run consistently no matter who does it!

Here's what you'll learn:

Demo: [TODO: Installing `fastlane`.]

First, you'll learn about `fastlane's` core tools and how to install and configure it for an iOS project.

Demo: [TODO: Run team code signing sync.]

Then, you'll learn how `fastlane` can automate and resolve common Development workflow problems like syncing team code signing certificates, device lists, and provisioning profiles.

Demo: [TODO: Test Flight and Third Party teasers.]

Next, I'll show you how to use `fastlane` to streamline the Beta Testing phase by automating how you build, submit, and distribute your beta test builds with either Apple TestFlight or a third party service.

Demo: [TODO: Sped up auto screenshot creation.]

Then, you'll see how `fastlane` can transform how you prepare, build and submit your app to the App Store. You'll learn to save hours and ulcers by automatically creating beautiful custom app screenshots and metadata for all of your app's supported languages and devices, and how to completely automate submitting your app and all its supporting assets to App Store Connect for release.

Demo: [TODO: Git workflow.]

Finally, you'll learn how to take `fastlane` beyond the App Store, to encompass the full range of your iOS team workflows and build processes, from guaranteed version bumps and git commits to automated testing, linting, documentation, notifications and more.
