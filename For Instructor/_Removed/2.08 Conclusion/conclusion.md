# Introduction
Congratulations on completing the second section of this course.
# Lecture
In this section, we've completed our tour of fastlane's actions for the development phase of iOS app development. 
You've learned about fastlane's ambitious and revolutionary approach to team-based code signing. As part of this you've  met your (ahem) `match` and discovered its capabilities, set up a private git repo to hold team credentials, and set up an automation lane that automatically refreshes your team credentials every time it's run. 
Then you learned how fastlane can improve how you handle advanced app capabilities and in-app notifications via `producde` and `pem`.
And best of all, you added all this functionality to your own growing set of lanes.
You'll continue to build on the lanes you've established in the next section, but this completes our focus on the development phase of app development.
# Conclusion
In the next section, we'll focus on the next app phase: beta testing and test distribution. There's a lot of exciting things to cover, and I think you'll really like this. See you thereâ€¦
