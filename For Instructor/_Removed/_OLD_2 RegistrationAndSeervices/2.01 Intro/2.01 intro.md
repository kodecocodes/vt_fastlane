# Introduction
Welcome to Section 2 of our course on Fastlane for iOS.
In the previous section, you learned about fastlane's ability to greatly improve every aspect of managing development code signing assets for your iOS apps. 
In this section, we'll start by reviewing the manual — and often laborious — process of registering an app with the Developer Portal, and then see how the fastlane action `produce` makes this a piece of cake.
Then we'll look at how services such as Maps, ApplePay, HealthKit, in-app Push Notifications, and much more. Once again, we'll review the workflow for doing this manually.
