# Intro

Your on-camera script bits go here! Leave that "# Intro" exactly as-is; we use it to generate special scripts for the teleprompter 🎥 📜 👩‍💼

Denote when a slide should come in like this:

**[Slide 01]** Lorem ipsum et cetera. 

## Subtopic Heading

**[Slide 02]** If you want to break your script up with subheadings, for your own reference, that's fine! Do it like that ☝️ with non-H1 headings. (As long as it's more than one, use as many #s as you want.)


# Demo

Your demo scripts go here! Use that "# Demo" exactly as-is, also!

## Subtopic Heading

You can also break up your demos into subtopics, like this!

* Let's declare a constant. Bulleted text like this is designed to go along with something that will happen on-screen:

```swift
let cat = "🐱"
```

Oh look! We made a cat constant. That's how you declare constants in Swift. (Don't use bullets for short descriptions of something you already did!)

Plain text, like this, should be infrequent. If you find yourself with about ten seconds worth of text, or more, without something to show on-screen, then consider using an on-camera interlude instead. Would this part be better explained with a diagram, illustration, or live-action prop? If so, use an interlude:

# Interlude

Add on-camera interludes like this!

**[Slide 03]** This is your chance to add just-in-time theory or interesting side notes. Then you can jump back into a demo...


# Demo

Get back to a demo like this!

* Next, you would do more demo things, like make a code comment.

```swift
//more code would go here...
```

<!--Use comments to put something into the script that shouldn't be read aloud, and the editor won't need. This is good for preparation instructions to yourself such as:

Open somewebsite.com in a full-screen browser before recording!
-->

> Use blockquotes to leave notes for yourself that your video editor will also want to be aware of, like: 

> Highlight `somelineofcode`

> Option-click on `MyClass` to show the documentation

--

> Blockquotes are also the place to leave notes that will only be useful to the video editor. These can be useful when you're writing, like this:

> Hey Editor! The next part, where I create a bunch of views, is repetitive. Leave the first one at normal speed, then go through the rest really fast, please!

> But they are also used *during* recording during recording. For example:
 
> Editor: I typed this next block of code wrong 5 times! You can skip ahead to the 6th attempt. 

# Conclusion

If you want an on-camera part at the very end of the video to wrap things up, add it like so.

You have made it to the end of the video! Good work. :]
