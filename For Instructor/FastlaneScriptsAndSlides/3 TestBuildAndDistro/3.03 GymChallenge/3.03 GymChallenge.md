# Introduction
In this episode, it's your turn to put `gym` to work, as you build out the custom lanes you've already created and integrate them with `gym`. Let's dive right in!
# Introducing the Challenge
## Basic Challenge
- Your challenge begins with the `Gymfile` we just reviewed: Configure this to use our project's "ChewChewTrain" schema, and to always run Clean on each build.
- Create a new `build_appstore` lane. 
	- Add a comment # sync team appstore creds, and then
	- Call gym and set it to store builds in a `build_AppStore` directory and use the right type for the App Store.
## Advanced Challenge
Your advanced challenge is interesting this time. First, a quick review: The syntax to enable lanes to accept parameters is `lane :name do |options|`, and you can access named parameter:value pairs passed in using `var = options[:type]`.  Using this:
- Rename your `sync_all_development` lane to `sync_signing_assets` and make it accept options.
- Insert a new line to get the value of any `type` parameter passed in, and then pass this to the lane's call to `match`.
Now you'll take advantage of your lanes new flexibility:
- Update `sync_all_appstore` with the new lane name and pass in a parameter of "appstore."
- Now duplicate your `build_appstore` lane and call the copy `build_adhoc`. 
- Update this lane to pass appropriate Ad Hoc values to `sync_signing_assets` and `gym`, and set gym's output directory to `build_Adhoc`
These challenges are heftier this time. Pause the video now, have fun, and we'll walk through everything once you're done. See you in a bit!

# Demo: Challenge Answers
## Basic Challenge
Welcome back. That was a more challenging set of challenges, and I hope you had fun. Let's review them:
I'll open our `Gymfile` and configure it to always do a clean before building and to use the desired scheme:
```ruby
clean(true)
scheme("ChewChewTrain")
```
Once again, remember that configuration files use method rather than parameter syntax. In other words, parentheses instead of colons here.
in Fastfile, I add a `build_appstore` lane, add a commented reminder to sync our app store creds, and stub out a call to `gym`
```ruby
  lane :build_appstore do
	# sync team appstore creds
    gym(
    )
  end
```
Now I add parameters for the output directory and build method. 
```ruby
  lane :build_appstore do
	# sync team appstore creds
    gym(
      output_directory: "build_AppStore",
      export_method: "app-store"
    )
  end
```
Take a moment to pause the video and fix any issues you may have had. 
Thanks. Let's run this now:
```ruby
fastlane build_appstore
```
A lot happened: fastlane has built an archive for app store submission and placed everything in a new `export_AppStore` subdirectory.  Sweet!
## Advanced Challenge
The advanced challenge starts with the existing `sync_all_developmentÂ ` lane:
```ruby
  lane :sync_all_development do
    match(type: "development")
  end
```
I'll rename this and enable it to accept options:
```ruby
  lane :sync_signing_assets do |options|
    match(type: "development")
  end
```
And then I'll assign the value of any `type` param passed it and then pass it on to `match`. I'll add a description while I'm here too for the sake of documentation:
```ruby
  desc "Sync Team Code-Signing Assets"
  lane :sync_signing_assets do |options|
    selectedType = options[:type]
    match(type: selectedType)
  end
```
I replace my `build_appstore` comment with a call to this method:
```ruby
  desc "Build for App Store submission"
  lane :build_appstore do
    sync_signing_assets(type: "appstore")
    gym(
      output_directory: "build_AppStore",
      export_method: "app-store"
    )
  end
```
Be aware that `gym` uses hyphens in its values, while `match` doesn't, so we use "appstore" without a hyphen with `sync_signing_assets` which wraps `match`, but "app-store" with a hyphen for `gym`. It is what it is :]
Finally, I make a copy of `build_appstore`, name it `build_adhoc`, and replace its App Store values with Ad Hoc ones. Once again, I have to dodge the Hyphen Monster:
```ruby
  desc "Build for Ad Hoc submission"
  lane :build_adhoc do
    sync_signing_assets(type: "adhoc")
    gym(
      output_directory: "build_AdHoc",
      export_method: "ad-hoc"
    )
  end
```
Once again, please pause and fix any issues you ran into.
I'll run my new lane:
```ruby
fastlane build_adhoc
```
Some pretty sweet stuff happens: Thanks to my new multi-functional code syncing lane, `match` syncs my ad hoc team code signing assets and then does all the heavy lifting of building my ad hoc binaries, putting them in new `export_Adhoc` folder. It's pretty sweet watching how much work fastlane is now doing on our behalf. 
# Conclusion
Congratulations. You've reached a couple of significant milestones in this episode:
First, you've created your first truly multi-purpose lane that takes options and reacts accordingly.
And you've reached a bit of a watershed with your 2 new build lanes: Both of these are now managing moderately complex custom workflows. You're reaching the point where your lanes are becoming capable of powering complete workflows. 
In the next episode, we'll take all this up another notch as we explore how fastlane can automate distribution of your test builds. See you there!
