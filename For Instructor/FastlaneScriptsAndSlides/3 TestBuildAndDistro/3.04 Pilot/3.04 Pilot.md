# Introduction
In this episode, we'll introduce `pilot`, the fastlane action that's dedicated to improve all things TestFlight. If you're not a fan of pointing, clicking, typing and endlessly waiting, I think you'll love this episode!
# Lecture:
## Without Fastlane
Conventionally, uploading an app to TestFlight looks something like this:
- **[Slide 1]** Log in to App Store Connect, navigate to MyApps, select a team and then the desired team app, select the TestFlight tab,  click Test Information, and finally, manually submit the needed info.
- **[Slide 2]** Manually submit a build, either via Xcode or App Store Connect. Either way, there are several more manual steps to click through, along with lots of thumb twiddling to be done.
- **[Slide 3]** Oops. Forgot to increment the build number. Rinse and repeat.
- **[Slide 4]** Add internal testers in App Store Connect, selecting `App Store Connect Users` and manually adjusting users as needed.
- **[Slide 5]** Now it's time to add external testers here. We select "All Testers", create or select groups, and either enter a CSV file we've manually created or enter and invite external users one by one. Then we select which build we want each external group to test and enter testing information for each group. 
There are variations and recent improvements from Apple, but the basic steps remain. Ad Hoc distribution is of course different, but not fundamentally different in most respects.

## Pilot
Fastlane's answer to this conventional festival of point, click, type, and wait is `pilot`. This action is so powerful, it has 2 aliases: `upload_to_testflight` and `testflight`.  
Once again, `pilot` follows standard conventions and uses fastlane's trademark sensible defaults, so basic CLI use is as simple as running:
```bash
fastlane pilot upload
```
I can quickly grab a helpful list of my uploaded builds and the download counts for each with:
```bash
fastlane pilot builds
```
Or list all testers with:
```bash
fastlane pilot list
```
Adding a new tester is simple:
```bash
fastlane pilot add new@guy.me
```
And so is removing one:
```bash
fastlane pilot remove later@gater.cc
```
I can even quickly grab more info about any user with:
```bash
fastlane pilot find mister_e@who.me
```
## Lane Use
Basic In-lane use is predictable and simple as usual:
```ruby
lane :zoom_baby do
  pilot
end
```
And `pilot` has a large contingent of parameters to let you tune its behavior in just about any way you might imagine.
## increment_build_number
Since we're automating things, there's no way we want to have to manually remember to increment our app's build number whenever we build and distribute our apps. Happily, `fastlane` has a dedicated action called `increment_build_number`. 
**[Slide 6]** Unlike the other actions we've seen, you can only run `increment_build_number` in a lane. This makes sense, because it's designed to be used as part of a larger process. 
By default the action simply increments the integer value of your build number by one. You can also optionally pass it a fixed value if desired.
There's one small caveat: By default, Xcode doesn't use a versioning system, and therefore won't increment its build number. 
**[Slide 7]** 
Here's how to resolve this: 
- open Xcode, select your target and choose Build Settings.
- Find the "Versioning System" property and set it to "Apple Generic".
You may note that Xcode interchanges the terms "Build" and "Current Project Version" in some places. Just keep an eye out for this.
Please take a moment to enable versioning. Pause your video and do this now. You'll use this functionality in your next challenge.
