# Introduction
We've reached the end of section 3, where we've focused on automating all things Test Building and Distribution. 
You've made some serious strides in this section.
- You've learned to use `gym` to effortlessly create customized, auto-incremented distribution-ready binaries that are fully tailored to the environment you'll use to distribute your app to your testers. 
- You've learned to use `pilot` to deliver your gym-built apps directly to iTunesConnect. 
- You've also seen the wide range of options available for third party Testing platforms. And you've seen just how easy `fastlane's` dedicated actions for these services are.
- Best of all, you've built all this power into your own custom lanes, which now stand ready and waiting to do your bidding.
As great as all that is, it's about to get better.
In the next section, we'll go after an even bigger prize: Streamlining the entire App submission process — snapshots, metadata, builds, submission… everything needed to get your app submitted and approved. I'll see you there!
