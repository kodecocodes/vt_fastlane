# Introduction
Welcome back!
In the past two sections, you've learned the basics of using fastlane in the command line and in lanes. You've focused on the initial Development phase of an app's lifecycle as we've done this.
In this section, we'll move on to the beta testing phase. There's a lot of great stuff here, and you'll meet some of fastlane's workhorse tools that automate and turbocharge this phase.
We'll begin with a review of the manual steps conventionally needed to build and package your apps for distribution. And you'll meet `gym`, fastlane's highly capable workhorse action for automating and dramatically streamlining this process.
Next, we'll turn to the process of manually distributing your builds to testers. Again, we'll first review how this is traditionally done, and then follow this with an introduction to `pilot`, the fastlane tool dedicated to vastly improving this part of the distribution build workflow.
Finally, you'll meet a unique, stand-alone fastlane tool named `boarding`. Boarding serves the special role of automatically creating a custom website designed to make it a snap for external testers to *enroll* to test your app.
As we turn up the throttle in this section, I think you'll see that the investment you've put into learning fastlane's basics until now will start to pay more and more dividends.
I'll you in the next episodeâ€¦
