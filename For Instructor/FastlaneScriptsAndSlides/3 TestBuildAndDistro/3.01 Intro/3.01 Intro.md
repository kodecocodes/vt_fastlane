# Introduction
Welcome back!
In the first two sections, you learned the basics of using `fastlane` in the command line and in lanes, and you focused on the initial Development phase of an iOS app's lifecycle.
**[Slide 1]** 
In this section, we'll move on to the beta testing phase. There's a lot of great stuff here, and you'll meet some of `fastlane's` workhorse tools to automate and turbocharge this phase.
**[Slide 2]** 
We'll begin this section with a review of the manual steps conventionally needed to build and package your apps for distribution. And you'll meet `gym`, `fastlane's` highly capable workhorse action for automating and dramatically streamlining this process.
**[Slide 3]** 
Next, we'll turn to the process of manually distributing your builds to testers. Again, we'll first review how this is traditionally done, and then follow this with an introduction to `pilot`, the `fastlane` tool dedicated to vastly improving your interactions with Apple’s `TestFlight`.
**[Slide 4]** 
Last, you'll see how `fastlane` makes it a snap to use almost any third party beta test and distribution service you can imagine.
As we turn up the throttle in this section, I think you'll see that the investment you've put into learning `fastlane's` basics until now will start to pay more and more dividends.
I'll you in the next episode…
