# Introduction
So far in this section, you've met fastlane's actions preparing our app metadata and screenshots for delivery, bringing us right at the cusp of being able to complete a full delivery workflow.
In this episode, you'll meet the fastlane that closes the loop by automatically delivering your code-signed app, metadata and screenshots directly to the App Store. 
**[Slide 1]** 
Aptly enough, this action is called `deliver`. Predictably — and wonderfully — it once again follows fastlane's excellent documentation and usage conventions.
# Demo
## Command Line
Let's start with the command line. I'll start by running:
```bash
fastlane deliver init
```
This creates a project  `./fastlane/metadata` directory, which I'll open up…
<!-- Show folder in Finder -->
This folder is well structured, and for each app language, provides a separate file for each key App Store metadata field. The nice thing about this is that this gives you a single, local source of truth for all your metadata, in every language you support. You can edit all this ahead of time, then let `deliver` validate and upload them for you. That's much nicer than entering them all manually into web forms, and a whole lot easier to maintain and upgrade.
With this in place, I'll run:
```bash
fastlane deliver
```
In this basic form, `deliver` presents an overview of the metadata and screenshots, and on our approval, upload them (but not our .ipa file) to the App Store. 
Although I'll typically do this from a lane, I could also include an .ipa and also submit it directly for review with:
```bash
fastlane deliver --ipa "my-app.ipa" --submit_for_review
```
Another variant that can be useful is to download previously uploaded screenshots and metadata using:
```bash
fastlane deliver download_screenshots
```
## Lane Use
But `deliver` shines within lanes, because it's built deliver your assembled assets to the App Store. 
Basic lane invocation is as simple as you'd hope:
```ruby
lane :magic do
  ...
  deliver
  ...
end
```
In this form, `deliver` works exactly as you saw the basic form in the command line do a moment ago.
To upload an .ipa, simply include its path.
```ruby
lane :magic do
  ...   
  deliver(
    ipa: "./Export_iTunesConnect/ChewChewTrain.ipa",
  )
  ...
end
```
By default, `deliver` will present a helpful confirmation web page and ask you to give it an ok before proceeding to upload your assets. If I wanted to skip this confirmation page and also immediately submit my app for approval, I'd say:
```ruby
lane :magic do
  ...   
  deliver(
    ipa: "./Export_iTunesConnect/ChewChewTrain.ipa",
    force: true,
    submit_for_review: true    
  )
  ...
end
```
Given the permutations possible when submitting an app, you won't be surprised that the action offers a lot of additional customization if needed. 
# Conclusion
**[Slide 2]** 
`deliver` provides the final piece of the puzzle we've been assembling in this section. It completes the circuit we've been working on in this section, quietly and efficiently transporting all of your meticulously assembled metadata, screenshots, and .ipa's to the App Store. 
In the next episode, it'll be your turn to put `deliver` to work in your own lanes. I'll see you there!
