# Introduction
In this episode, you'll learn how to set up `snapshot` for a project, so that it can capture and organize every screenshot you need for your app.
# Lecture
**[Slide 1]** Snapshot documentation home
Once again, `snapshot` follows fastlane's wonderfully consistent document and usage conventions, so that once it's set up, it works and "thinks" just as you'd expect. 
However, as you've seen, `snapshot` leverages a significantly different set of underlying tools to do its magic. Because of this, setup is different than for other actions you've seen. 
To set up `snapshot` for a project,
**[Slide 2]** 
<!-- Editor: Please click slide to match bullet points -->
- You begin by creating a dedicated UI Test Target and Scheme in Xcode.
- Next, you run `snapshot init` in Terminal to generate a custom `SnapshotHelper` Swift file.
- Back in Xcode, add `Snapshot Helper` to your Test target and then
- Record a simple UI test  steps through each desired view
- And last, you add simple code snippets to trigger each snapshot

By the way, if you're new to iOS UI Testing or would like a refresher, a great starting point is our [Testing in iOS][1] video course. That said, in a moment I'll show you how to easily record a walkthrough of the screens we need to snapshot.
# Demo
## Setup
Let's take a closer look…
With our sample project open, I create a new Target
First, I'll open my Xcode project and create a new Target. I select "iOS **UI** Testing Bundle" (careful not to choose "iOS **Unit** Testing Bundle" by mistake). I'll name this `Fastlane Snapshots`. 
To keep this fully separated from my actual UI Tests, I create a new scheme, also named `Fastlane Snapshots`, linking it to my target of the same name. Before leaving, I make sure the Build tab's "Run" checkbox is ticked. `snapshot` needs this to be able to trigger my screenshots.
Now in Terminal, I run:
```ruby
snapshot init
```
This creates a new `Snapfile` that we'll view in a moment.
In Xcode once again, I add `SnapshotHelper` to my `FastlaneScreenshots` target. You can store this wherever you'd like. 
After clearing out its template code, configure the `setUp()` method:
```swift
    let app = XCUIApplication()
    setupSnapshot(app)
    app.launch()
```
Now I need to create my UITest. I stub out a new `testSnapshot()` method, put my cursor on a blank line inside it and click "Record". Once device or simulator is launched, every action I take will be added to my method. 
I step through my screens, then click Record once again to end recording. And my code to step through my screens is all set.
Now I just need to insert a  `snapshot` function call at each point where I want a snapshot taken. I can use its simplest form, which takes a name. Since the name I pass will be appended to an auto-generated name, I assign each snapshot instance an underscore-separated number and brief name.
By the way, doing this will be part of your basic challenge in the next episode. Feel free to return to this section as needed then.
## Snapfile
The last thing we need to do is to tune the Snapfile that's generated when you run `snapshot init`. 
`Snapfile` is another fastlane Ruby configuration file that holds defaults for all uses of `spanshot`, whether in the CLI or lanes. In addition to typical parameter settings, this is also your command center for specifying the matrix of devices and languages `snapshot` should generate for a project on each run.
I'll configure my Snapfile for our project like this:
```ruby
devices([
"iPhone 8 Plus", 
"iPhone SE", 
"iPhone XS", 
"iPhone XS Max"
])

languages([
  "en-US",
  "de-DE",
])

scheme "FastlaneSnapshots" 
skip_open_summary true
erase_simulator true
clear_previous_screenshots true
```
I've set this to generate snapshots for several iPhones (our sample app isn't optimized for iPad), and for US English and German. I also specify an Xcode scheme and instruct `snapshot` to:
- Clear our all previously created screenshots before beginning
- Reset all simulators and our ChewChewTrain app on every run, and
- Stop on any error.
## Command line test
Now that everything's set up, we can run snapshot in either the command line or lanes as you'd expect. Let's take things for a spin in the command line.
```ruby
fastlane snapshot
```
As `snapshot` starts chugging, don't be surprised to hear your fans kick in. `snapshot` automatically takes advantage of modern Xcoder's ability to run multiple simultaneous simulators. 
When `snapshot` finishes, it gives a clean visual summary in Terminal, and by default, it also creates and opens a great HTML document showing every snapshot generated, for every device, for every language. The `skip_open_summary` parameter can be used to control this behavior. 
Finally, back in Finder I can see that my newly-created images are cleanly stored in a `Fastlane Snapshots` folder, which is organized by each project language, then namespaces by device and file names. The auto-generated html file lives in this directory as well. 
## Wrapping Up
OK. That's our review of `snapshot`. As you can see, because it uses a different set of tools to do its heavy lifting, setup is a bit more involved than elsewhere in `fastlane`. Even so, once you've done it a time or two, setup is straightforward and quick. And with the preliminaries checked off, snapshot is so smooth that it's easy to forget that it's any different from the rest of the `fastlane` family of actions. That's no small feat of engineering or user experience!
# Conclusion
In the next episode, it'll be your turn to call "lights, camera, action" as you add `snapshot` to your `release` lane. See you there…
