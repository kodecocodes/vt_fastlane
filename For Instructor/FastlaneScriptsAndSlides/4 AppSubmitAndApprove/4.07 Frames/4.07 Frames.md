# Introduction
Thanks to `snapshot`, we're now able to generate complete sets of app screenshots with one easy command. 
But brilliant as that is, our end game is to create the best possible screenshots for our app and have them ready for automated submission to the App Store: To get to our happy place, we'll need to inset our screenshots into production-worthy device frameworks and resize them to  requiredApp Store dimensions. That's just what we'll do in this episode.
# Lecture
## The Hard Way
**[Slide 1]** 
Manually placing each screenshot within matching device-specific frameworks isn't technically difficult. It just require downloading frame images and then doing a lot of manual legwork to exactly size and inset each screenshot into each frame in an app like Sketch or Photoshop. 
Doable? Sure. Good use of our time or skills? Not so much. Once again, we really want to automate this.
**[Slide 2]**
The `fastlane` superhero of this episode goes by the name of `frameit`.  As its name implies, `frameit`  is designed to wrap device-specific frames around your raw generated screenshots, and to do it with panache.
## Installing ImageMagick
**[Slide 3]** 
Before you can run `frameit` , you do need to install a helper utility called `ImageMagick`. If you're not familiar with it, `ImageMagick` is a long-time cross-platform command line utility that packs a lot of image processing power. Since you have homebrew installed, installing it's a snap. Simply run 
```bash
brew install imagemagick
```
Take a moment to pause the video and do this now.  I'll wait here :-]

## Command Line
Thanks for doing that, and now onwards… 
We'll cover `frameit` 2 parts: first, basic usage, and then adding backgrounds and resizing images to App Store specs.
Once you've installed Image Magick, using `frameit` is a snap, and once again, it follows standard fastlane conventions in both the command line and lanes.
However, there is one small gotcha worth knowing about. 
When run in the command line, `frameit` recursively finds and attempts to frame all images within the current directory.  And since you'll likely be in the project root, that means it will step through all the image files in your project. 
That's not as bad as it sounds, because frameit only frames files exactly matching target device dimensions. Still, it's not desirable. And unfortunately, frameit in the command line doesn't support a path option, nor can you define this in a configuration file.
Given this, I'd suggest that you either:
- Only run `frameit` from lanes, or…
- If you choose to run  the raw`frameit` action in the command line, always cd into your `sreenshots` directory first.
## Lane Use
Using `frameit` in a lane is clean and simple:
```ruby
lane :frame_me do
  frameit(rose_gold: true, path: "./fastlane/screenshots")
end
```
We're able to specify the path to our screenshots here. You can optionally specify a device color, and `frameit` will fall back to a sensible available color if that color isn't available for a device type.
I'll run this now…
```bash
fastlane frame_me
```
… and frameit steps through the screenshots in my path, using Image Magick to inset each image into a new set of suffixed `_framed.png` files. 
<!-- Step through results in Mojave Gallery View -->
Stepping through the resulting images, those frames are looking pretty sweet!
# Interlude:
Sweet as our framed images are, they're a bit… generic. We'd like to be able to add more personality to them, since they're the images likely to determine if our potential customers will decide our app is worth installing.
**[Slide 4]**
To customize our images, we'd like to be able to apply captions (remembering that these need to be specific for each scene in each language). We'd also like to specify things like the font properties and placement of our captions, along with a background image for each.
**[Slide 5]**
Because we need the ability to specify settings down to the scene-language level, we'll need a deep structure able to accommodate this. We won't be able to use the kind of simple method parameters or flat-structured configuration files as we've seen so far.
To address these needs, we'll need to manually create  `Framefile.json` and place it in the `.fastlane/screenshots` subdirectory. 
Note that this is the first time we've seen a `.json` file, and it's here precisely because `JSON` can handle the depth we need in this case.
**[Slide 6]**
The general form of the Framefile looks like this \<points to side\>. It has 2 main parts:
<!-- Editor: Please click twice to reveal captions matching these 2 points. -->
- `default` takes an object containing settings like font type, color, offset and position, device sizing and background image.
-  `data` takes an array of scene-specific settings, allowing us to customize any scene as desired. Be aware that these settings are shared across all language instances of a scene.
Note that if you reference any assets in this file — like font or background image — you'll need to provide their path relative to the `screenshots` directory.
# Demo
## Project Framefile
Back in our project, I'll add a new Framefile:
```json
{
  "device_frame_version": "latest",
  "default": {
    "keyword": {
      "font": "./fonts/Chalkduster.ttf"
    },
    "title": {      
      "color": "#B35800"
    },
    "padding": 50,
    "title_below_image": true,
    "background": "./background.jpg",
    "show_complete_frame": true
  },
  "data": []
} 
```
Note that this references a custom font and a background image, both of which will be stored in the `screenshots` directory. We won't customize per-scene settings in the `data` property, as we'll handle this separately for each language, next.
## Per language settings
The second piece of this puzzle is adding any per-language / per-scene captions or other settings.
Since these are language-specific, the right place to do this is within our language-specific folders. `frameit` lets us add Xcode-standard `.strings` files in each language-specific folder for this purpose. This approach fits nicely with standard app translation workflows. The `.strings` format requires that it's first line be left blank, and then takes the format "name" = "value".
I'll open my `en_US` folder and add my first `title.strings` file:
```

"1_Launch" = "Make Training Fun!";
"2_HowItWorks" = "As Simple as ABC!";
"3_BecauseScience" = "Because… Science!";
"4_Challenge" = "Fun Challenges!";
"5_Reward" = "You Both Get Treats!";
```
And then I'll do the same in our `de-DE` folder:
```

"1_Launch" = "Machen Sie Spaß beim Training!";
"2_HowItWorks" = "So einfach wie ABC!";
"3_BecauseScience" = "Weil… Wissenschaft!";
"4_Challenge" = "Spaß Herausforderungen!";
"5_Reward" = "Sie bekommen beide Leckereien!";
```
Note that the name of each entry acts as a filter, letting frameit match each entry to a specific scene. Because of this, the order of these entries doesn't matter — only that each name entered uniquely matches one of your screenshot scenes.
## Putting it all Together
Alright. Let's take a look at what we get for this effort:
```bash
fastlane frame_me
```
<!-- show English results in Gallery view -->
With our Framefile and title.strings files in place, our framed photos are now inset within a backgrounders image. Each scene gets a unique title, and …
<!-- switch to German language folder -->
…each language gets its its own captions.. Nice.
# Conclusion
**[Slide 7]** 
As you can see, `frameit` is a powerful and flexible tool that can transform your raw screenshots into complete, App Store-ready images. 
Because of the deep device and language-driven structure of app screenshots, frameit does take more setup than most fastlane tools. But this setup isn't difficult, and your efforts will be more than repaid in very short order.
**[Slide 8]** 
In the next episode, you'll learn how to complete the cycle and deliver your framed and customized screenshots directly to the App Store, via an action that's aptly named… `deliver`. See you there…
