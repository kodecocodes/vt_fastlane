# Introduction
In this episode, you'll add `frameit` and `deliver` to your `Fastfile`. With a single command, your `release` lane will handle the entire process of pre-checking, building, snapshotting and framing, and ultimately delivering your app and all its metadata to the App Store. 
# Introducing the Challenge
## Basic Challenge
Your main challenge is to complete your :release lane. Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll do:
- Your lane doesn't currently build your app for submission. Make it run your `build_appstore` lane right after `precheck`.
- Next, add `frameit`  after you call `snapshot` and configure it to use your favorite iPhone color.
- Last, call `deliver` without any parameters.
Run you lane. It should scan your metadata, version bump and build your distributable archive, generate and frame your snapshots, present you with an HTML report, and on confirmation, deliver your  meta assets (but not your archive file) to the App Store.
## Advanced Challenge
Your advanced challenge is bring this all the way home. To do this:
- Move `Framefile.json`, `background.jpg`, and the `fonts` directory from `./courseAssets` to `./fastlane/screenshots`, and the two copies of `title.strings` from their `en-US` and `de-DE` sub directories in  `./courseAssets` to the matching subdirectories in `./fastlane/screenshots`.
- Then in your `release` lane, configure  `deliver` to:
	- Upload the `.ipa` created by `build_appstore`
	- Skip `precheck` *and* HTML report file verification
	- If needed, set your `team_name`
Run your lane once again. This time, `frameit` should now apply custom background, per-language titles, font and colors to each app scene. And `deliver` should now upload your code-signed, version-bumped binary, all without any intervention on your part.
All right. Give that your best shot, and have fun!  I'll see you when you're done.

# Demo: Challenge Answers
Welcome back! I hope you had fun with these challenges. Let's walk through them together now:
## Basic Challenge
In my `release` lane, I add a call to `build_appstore` after I run `precheck`. Then I call `frameit`, choosing `gold` device frames. Last, I invoke `deliver`. 
```ruby
  lane :release do
    precheck
    build_appstore
    snapshot
    frameit(gold: true)
    deliver
  end
```
Please pause your video and correct any issues if needed, and then run your `release` lane.
# Pause


# Resume
I'll save my changes and run my lane:
```ruby
fastlane release
```



Andâ€¦ well, we have good news and bad news.
Our `release` lane `prechecked` our app, built a new version-bumped .ipa file, assembled and framed our snapshots. It would also have uploaded our metadata and screenshots, but because our configuration isn't complete, we're getting a blocking "Unsupported screen size error" that we'll need to resolve.
We'll do this in our advanced challenged, where we'll also add the key fastlane assets needed, and of course have `deliver` upload our  `.ipa` file. 


## Advanced Challenge
Let's make it so.
I've located the Materials folder for this episode. From here, I'll first copy the fonts, background, and fonts folder into fastlane's screenshots subfolder. 

Then I'll copy the German and US English instances of`title.strings` into their matching subdirectories within the screenshots folder. 

Now I'll update our `release` lane in Fastfile, where I'll add parameters to `deliver` to tune its behavior. 
I set the path to our `.ipa`file. I turn off the redundant precheck, suppress the confirmation HTML page by setting force to true, and set my team name to avoid a prompt. 
```ruby
    

    deliver
  end


lane :release do
	precheck
    build_appstore
    snapshot
    frameit(gold: true)
	
    deliver(
      ipa: "./build_AppStore/ChewChewTrain.ipa",
      run_precheck_before_submit: false,
      force: true,
      team_name: "Brian Schick"
      )
  end
```
Once again, please pause and update your lanes and project if you had any issues, and be sure to run your lane.
# Pause


# Resume
I'll save my changes and run the release lane once again.
```ruby
fastlane release
```


This time, our `release` lane brings everything full circle. Our .ipa, screenshots and other assets have been successfully uploaded and submitted to App Store Connect. And our screenshots have been framed, sized and captioned with custom font, title and backgrounds. 
The whole process now happens without any intervention on my part, and I love seeing the completion message that `fastlane` just saved me 20 minutes. I can get used to this!

# Conclusion
Congratulations! Your `release` lane has come full circle, as it now handle the entire process of building and submitting a release for the App Store. 
Take a moment to feel an extremely well-deserved sense of accomplishment at what you've just achieved. And I'll see you in the next episode.
