# Introduction
Welcome to section 4 of fastlane for iOS.
In this section, you'll learn how fastlane can help you streamline the Release phase of iOS app development. Maybe even better, you'll see how using fastlane's release tools can not only save you mountains of time, but can also improve the quality of the customer-facing mata snapshots and metadata you'll submit to the App Store with every new release.
**[Slide 1]** 
First, you'll meet `precheck`, fastlane's action that checks all your app meta content for issues that could get it rejected.
**[Slide 2]** 
Next, you'll learn how you can automatically create all the screenshots for your app — across all target devices — automatically with fastlane `snapshot`, and then you'll meet `frameit`, which lets you place each image in a beautiful custom device frame.
**[Slide 3]** 
Finally, you'll meet `deliver`, the workhorse action that handles an extraordinary amount of work and manages the entire process of submitting all these assets to the App Store.
And, of course, you'll continue adding these to your own set of custom lanes. By the end of this section, your lanes will address the full scope of the app development cycle — from initial development, through beta distribution and testing, and finally, to getting your app up on the App Store.
See you in the next episode…
