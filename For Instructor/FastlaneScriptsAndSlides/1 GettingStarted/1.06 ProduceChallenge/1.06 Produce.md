# Introduction
In this episode, you'll learn about the core structure of a fastlane *lane*, and then you'll roll up your sleeves and build your first lane, using `produce`. Let's dive right in…
# Lecture
## Introducing the Lane
**[Slide 1]**
In the last episode, you saw how we can invoke a fastlane action directly in the command line. We'll use that form of actions throughout this course, largely as a convenient sandbox for quickly learning about each action.
But as you know, the heart of fastlane is the *lane.* Lanes tie together individual actions, unlocking and magnifying their real power as they create complete workflows.
Each lane is defined in the project **Fastfile**. 
Because their Ruby syntax may be foreign to you, we'll begin this challenge with a walkthrough of their key conventions. I promise… they're not at all hard to quickly grok…
## A Lane's Anatomy
**[Slide 2]**
Here's a sample Fastfile. Out of the box, it's immediately clear Ruby is **not** a C-style language — no curly brackets or keywords like `var`, `let`, `func` here.
**[Slide 3]**
But we can immediately recognize a block that runs when the platform is iOS, and that two lanes — named "first" and "second" — are defined here. `platform` and `lane` are Ruby functions. Ruby doesn't require require parentheses for functions when they have zero or one parameters. 
**[Slide 4]**
In place of curly brackets, Ruby use `do` - `end` pairings to denote blocks. Coming from a C-style language, this may look strange but it's an easy adjustment.
**[Slide 5]**
Ruby Symbols may be the most alien thing here. You can think of them as a defined-in-place let constants. You'll see these frequently in fastlane, and in every custom lane declaration.
**[Slide 6]**
Within a given lane, you call fastlane actions in the order you want them to run. Each invocation of an action is another Ruby method call, and you're able to include whatever parameters an action's method supports to further tune its performance.
**[Slide 7]** Comments
Last, inline comments in Ruby are prefaced with a simple hash mark. 
# Introducing the Challenge
**[Challenge Slide ]**
With that background under your belt, it's time for you to create your first lane. Here's your first challenge:
- Open `.fastlane/Fastfile` in your code editor and make sure  syntax is set to `Ruby`.
- Replace all the `Fastfile's` boilerplate code with:
```ruby
default_platform(:ios)

platform :ios do

end
```
- All your lanes will go within the `platform :ios` block. Create a new lane within this, and name it `:register_app`.
- Inside this lane, add a single call to `produce`. You don't need to include any parameters at this time.
We'll also have advanced challenges throughout this course, and I strongly encourage you to do them as well. 
Your advanced challenge this time is to:
- include parameters for username, app identifier, app name, and — if you belong to more than one development team — your App Store Connect and Developer Portal team names.
We did this in the command line in the last episode, but your challenge here will be to find and use the Ruby lane parameters. 
By the way, other than the optionality of parentheses we discussed, Ruby function syntax is quite close to Swift's. For example, If I have a Ruby function `foo` that takes params `bar` and `bas`, I can invoke this either as:
```ruby
foo(bar: true, bas: "some value")
```
or:
```ruby
foo(
  bar: true,
  bas: "some value"
)
```
Please the video now and give that a try. If you get stuck, no worries… we'll review everything when you're done. See you on the other side…
# Pause for Challenge
# Demo: Challenge Answers
## Basic Challenge
Welcome back! Let's take a look at this together:
- I start by opening the default Fastfile in my code editor. I need to manually set the syntax to Ruby since the file lacks an extension. In my editor, I'll just click the language affordance and select Ruby. Ah… that's better!
- I remove the boilerplate code, and then I create a new lane and name it `:register_app`. I make sure to make my lane name a Ruby symbol, and I follow the Ruby convention of using 2 space indents.
```ruby
default_platform(:ios)

platform :ios do

  lane :register_app do

  end

end
```
- Last, I'll add a call to `produce` within my app. Note that when I'm calling an action within a lane, I do NOT use the `fastlane` keyword as I do in the command line.
	```ruby
	lane :register_app do
	  produce
	end
	```
	Not too bad, right? Ruby syntax is decidedly different from Swift's C-style curly bracket approach, but it's elegant and clean. And like Swift, it lets you work nicely with the "metal" of your code.
All right. Let's switch over the Terminal and go for a quick cruise in our new fastlane:
```ruby
fastlane register_app
```
`fastlane` zips our lane and produce goes to work for us. We're still prompted for our creds, which we'll take care of soon. And notice that since we previously registered our app (in the command line), `produce` intelligently recognizes that there's nothing to do. Nice!
If you didn't run your lane previously — or if you had errors — please pause your video and make sure your code runs as expected.
## Advanced Challenge
On to your advanced challenge. The main hurdle here was likely honing in on the lane-specific parameters and not accidentally using command line options. The documentation needed is found in the `Parameters` section at the very bottom of `produce`'s documentation. This is yet another shared pattern you'll see repeated across fastlane actions.
Here's how my lane looks with our parameters entered:
```ruby
  lane :register_app do
    produce(
      username: "bschick1@mac.com",
      app_identifier: "com.razeware.ChewChewTrain",
      app_name: "Chew Chew Train",
      team_name: "Brian Schick",
      itc_team_name: "Brian Schick"
    )
  end
```
One  heads up: The Ruby parameter names here exactly matched their command line option equivalents. That's often — but not always — the case. The documentation for each action is your BFF here.
OK. I'll save my changes and run my lane once more. 
```ruby
fastlane register_app
```
Nice! No prompts this time, making the results easier to parse too.
Once again, if you haven't done so already, please take a moment to make these changes (obviously replacing my username and team names with your own) and try this out for yourself now, before moving on.

# Conclusion
Congratulations! You've learned the basics of lane structure and create your first lane. We're not blowing any minds just yet, but this is a nice start you'll build on.
In the next episode, you'll learn how fastlane can automate managing you Development code signing assets. See you there…
