# Introduction
Welcome back, and congratulations on completing the second section of this course.
# Lecture
Over the course of this section, we've finished our tour of `fastlane` actions aimed at the development phase of iOS app development. 
You've learned about `fastlane's` ambitious and revolutionary approach to team-based code signing. As part of this you've  met your (ahem) `match` and discovered its capabilities. You’ve set up a private git repo to hold team credentials, and then set up an automation lane that automatically refreshes your team credentials every time it's run. 
You've also learned a good deal more about how best to use fastlane, both in the command line and in lanes. And you’ve learned a lot of new techniques that help your lanes work together better – with more power – and with helpful documentation.
And of course, you've completed and tuned your lanes for the development phase of iOS development.
# Conclusion
In the next section, we'll turn our focus to second core phase of iOS development: beta testing and test distribution. There's a lot of exciting things in store, and I think you'll really that you’ll learn next. 
See you there…
