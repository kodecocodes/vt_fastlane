# Intro
In this episode, you'll meet your `match`. By which I of course mean, you'll meet fastlane's premiere action for implementing its ambitious vision of team-oriented code-signing.
# Lecture
## Introducing Match
**[Slide 1]** 
`match` is designed to fully deliver on fastlane's ambitious vision for team-based code signing. `match` is tasked with handling the heavy lifting of creating, encrypting, and securely storing a team's certificates and profiles in a single git repository, and then again to retrieve, decrypt, and utilize these on individual developer's machines.
One measure of `match's` ambition is fastlane's pledge that a team can set up code signing on a new machine in less than a minute! Another is its promise to make all the machinery of maintaining this schema transparent. These are big visions to live up to: Let's take a closer look.
## Setting up a Private Git Repository
**[Slide 2]** 
To use match, you must first set up a a **private** git repository dedicated solely to store your team certificates.  Again, your code signing repo must be  **private** or life as we know it will end. 
At the time of recording, GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket all let you create private repos with free accounts. It's your choice.
Here are the basic steps to set this up:
**[Slide 3]** 
- If needed, choose a service, create a free account, and provide your basic info and public key. Be sure to both use a strong, unique password, and set up Two Factor authentication. 
- Log into your account and begin creation of a new `repository`. Note that gitlab uses the term `project` instead of the standard git term `repository`.
- Make sure that you make your new repo **private**. 
- Name the account "Certificates" or similar and complete its creation.
- Do one last check that your repo is really private. 
Rather than ask you to do this in our next challenge, I'll ask you to please take a moment and do this right now. Take your time to make sure to set up 2 factor auth, and double check that your repo is private. Please pause the video now, make it so, and resume when you're done.
# Pause for Setup
# Resume
Welcome back, and thanks for setting that up. 
**[Slide 4]**
There's one last optional setup step to review.
Fastlane suggests you might want to add a new Apple Developer Portal account and dedicate this to match team assets. This dedicated account — perhaps named something like **team@myorg.com** — avoids mixing personal and team-based assets in the same bucket. I'd recommend this as a best practice.
Once again, if you'd like to do this, please go ahead and set this up now.
## Match
**[Slide 5]** 
With the preliminaries set up, it's time to meet your… match. Match documentation and usage follow the same conventions you've seen with the other fastlane actions you've met so far. Note that match is an alias the the sync_code_signing action.
# Demo
## Initializing Match
match does introduce one new twist: Because it requires access to your new private repository, we begin by running:
```bash
fastlane match init
```
We're prompted to enter the URL of our private git repo and the process completes with a helpful summary. 
<!-- Show in Finder / Code -->
As you can see, this has created a new `Matchfile` with your repo's URL. You've previously seen `Appfile` and , and you'll encounter several more examples of storing project information in this kind of a settings file. An additional benefit to this approach is that all configurations are automatically committed — and shared to all team members — as part of the project repo itself.
## Removing the Clutter
There's one last optional setup step: If instead of creating a fresh account, you've opted to reuse an existing developer account with `match`, fastlane recommends you clear out your preexisting certificates and profiles. To do this, you'd run:
```bash
fastlane match nuke development
fastlane match nuke distribution
fastlane match nuke enterprise
```
## Creating Team Dev Certs and Profiles
That takes care of our one time set up, and we're ready to set up a whole new set of development assets, encrypt and upload them to my our git repo, and store the decrypted keys locally. 
All it takes to do all this in the command line is:
```bash
fastlane match development
```
Match prompts for our app bundle identifier, then a passphrase for encryption. Take this passphrase every bit as seriously as you would any mission-critical password: Make it strong, unique and store it securely. I'm using 1Password to generate and securely store mine.
For completeness, I'll also run:
```bash
fastlane match adhoc
fastlane match appstore
```
…so that we'll have these in place later on when we need them.
## Reviewing the Results
Once again, please pause if needed to complete these steps now.
All right. Let's view the results in our private repo…
<!-- show repo in browser -->
With that single command, match has created a full set of team development code signing assets. All certificates with their private keys live in a `certs` folder, and all profiles live in the `profiles` folder, all encrypted by OpenSSL. **match** also adds a README with helpful onboarding instructions for other team members. Sweet!
From here on out, whenever I need to set up a new development machine for my team, all I'll have to do is follow this simple READ ME, and the new machine will be good to go! 
That's it for setup. Now let's look at using match in a lane:
# Lecture
## Lane use
As with other actions you've seen, using `match` in a lane is clean and simple: 
**[Slide 6]** 
You don't need to include your git info here, because it's cleanly stored in your newly-created `Matchfile`. 
Currently, match is only addressing `development` code signing assets. You'll later add `adhoc` and `appstore` when we focus on these phases of app development.
**[Slide 7]** 
One particularly useful parameter is `force_for_new_devices`. It automatically regenerates your provisioning profile if your team's device count has changed. You can alternately simply use the `force` option, which causes the profile to be regenerated every time the lane is run, and you'll use this in your upcoming challenge.
# Conclusion
Match delivers on fastlane's vision of making it easy to use a team-based approach to code signing. In the next episode, you'll get hands-on experience with match, as you create a new lane just for match actions. See you there!
