# Introduction
So far in this section, we've stepped beyond the box of the App Store and explored several ways that fastlane actions can extend and further empower workflows. As you've seen, fastlane's native actions encompass a vast amount of functionality beyond well beyond the App Store ecosystem.
But we're not done quite yet. In this episode, we'll take yet another step outside the box to explore the several options open to you if you want to boldly go where fastlane doesn't yet go.   
# Lecture
**[Slide 1]** 
`fastlane` is built by and for developers, engineers, and tinkerers. So it probably won't come as a surprise that if and when you encounter a situation fastlane can't handle out of the box, you'll have several options awaiting you. Explorers are absolutely welcome on the fastlane!
## 1. Check available actions first
**[Slide 2]** 
Before gearing up to create a slick new wheel, don't forget to check the list of available actions first: It's easy to overlook actions and assume they're not there. 
**[Slide 3]** 
As a quick example: We just covered Slack notifications, but suppose your team prefers another service. The Notifications sections of the Actions page reveals that out of the box, fastlane has actions for HipChat, GroupChat, Flock, Typetalk, Twitter, Mailgun, and even local macOS notifications. This kind of broad coverage is typical of many categories, and means that if you can use one of these supported channels, problem solved!
## Shell commands and Helper lanes
Next, you might ask if you can do what you'd like in the command line. If so, you can likely use fastlane's shell capabilities.
**[Slide 4]** 
Here's a very simple example: In the last episode, I wanted to be able to get a current timestamp and pass that to Slack. There's no native date or time functionality in fastlane, but it was a simple matter to grab that from the shell:
**[Slide 5]** 
If I wanted to be able to use this functionality throughout my project, I could easily create a private lane wrapping this:
**[Slide 6]** 
And from then, I could use this as though it were native to fastlane:
There are natural limits to this approach, but it's a nice first option for things the command line does well.
## Third party plugins
**[Slide 7]** 
If your problem's still not solvable, you next step will likely be to check for existing third party plugins. By the way, this is made possible by an altogether excellent decision  by Felix Krause and the fastlane team to design fastlane as an open, readily extensible platform. Cheers, guys!
**[Slide 8]** 
Fastlane's comprehensive list of third party plugins is a direct link from the root documentation page. Each action is well-documented, exposes its contributors, actions, overall score, and GitHub source code, with highest scoring items sorted to the top.
**[Slide 9]**
Fastlane also provides robust command line tools to assist you in finding and installing plugins directly into your project. These are documented in its "Use Plugins" guide \<point to slide\\\\\>
# Demo
## Finding a plugin
Let's take a closer look. The action for searching plugins is `search_plugins`. You can run this without arguments, but it's usually more useful to include a search term:
```ruby
fastlane search_plugins icon
```
Nice! I can see several actions designed to do, and once again, the list is sorted by downloads. Looking through these, I'm interested in the second item — "appIcon". I'd like to have fastlane automatically generate all my icon sizes for me as part of the build process. 
<!-- navigate to https://github.com/KrauseFx/fastlane-plugin-appicon -->
I'll do a quick reality check on the web page. I can see that this is the fourth most popular plugin, and when I check its git info, I like what I see. I'll need to install a support library with Homebrew, but that's nice and easy. Let's add it to our project…
## Installing a plugin
I'll first install the listed dependency with Homebrew:
```ruby
brew install graphicsmagick
```
And then I'll add the plugin to my project with fastlane:
```ruby
fastlane add_plugin appicon
```
This creates a new project `Pluginfile` and updates my project `Gemfile`.
Once installed, I can get info about lane use as with any built-in action:
```ruby
fastlane actions appicon
```
## Using in a lane
Let's put this to use, As suggested, I place a single 1024 x 1024 file at `/fastlane/metadata/app_icon.png` Then I create a simple lane calling my plugin and specifying the icon types desired and the path to my project Assets:
```ruby
lane :ike do
      appicon(
      appicon_devices: [:iphone, :ios_marketing],
      appicon_path: "ChewChewTrain/Assets.xcassets"
    )
end
```
Now I can run my lane:
```ruby
fastlane ike
```
…which completes very quickly. Let's take a look at the results in Xcode…

Eureka! 
# Lecture
## Crafting your own Plugins
**[Slide 10]**
If you've explored all these options and discover that what you need really hasn't been addressed, it's likely time to write your own third party plugin.
While the details of this are beyond our scope, here are some starting points:
- `fastlane's` "Create you own fastlane plugin" page \<point to slide\> is a good starting point and points to fastlane helper actions like the `new_plugin` action that can help you get oriented
- Consider making an investment in taking your Ruby skills beyond what we've needed in this course. Among other things, you'll need to be comfortable creating and submitting Ruby Gems. 
- Consider cloning the repo of a plugin you use and like, then using this as a starting point. This is a great way to learn both fastlane specifics and Ruby coding practices by example. 
# Conclusion
**[Slide 11]** 
`fastlane's` extensible architecture lays the foundations for extending `fastlane` almost anyplace you might like to go with it. Because of this, a wealth of third party plugins can quickly be scanned and integrated directly into your projects. And once integrated, it's easy to forget these plugins are any different from native actions. And if you're ready to take the next step and build your own plugins, the fastlane platform and community are ready and waiting…
In the next episode, we'll wrap things up with an exploration of `fastlane` best practices.
