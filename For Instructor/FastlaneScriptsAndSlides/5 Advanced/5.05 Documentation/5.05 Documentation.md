# Introduction
In this episode, we'll add automatic project documentation to our fastlane workflow.
# Lecture
**[Slide 1]** 
As we're automating more and more of our developer actions, it makes sense to consider integrating documentation into this scheme. 
As we've already seen with git, unit test, and lint integration, by doing this, we guarantee that it happens every time we build, and no matter which team member is driving. That's especially critical with documentation, since out of date docs are often worse than nothing at all.
## Basics
**[Slide 2]** 
We'll leverage another Realm open source tool for this task, a soulful documentation hero that goes by the name of `Jazzy`. `Jazzy` thoughtfully supports both Swift and Objective-C. 
**[Slide 3]** 
And once again, we'll leverage yet another fastlane purpose-built action, hear called… yep… `jazzy`.  


# Demo
<!-- Show Jazzy's instructions -->
To get started, we need to manually install jazzy. Following the Jazzy's Installation instructions, I'll run:
```ruby
gem install jazzy
```
<!-- Switch to Fastfile in code editor -->
While you can run `jazzy` in the command line, we'll focus solely on lane use. I'll set up a simple lane for this purpose:
```ruby
lane :document do
  jazzy
end
```
I'll save and run it:
```
fastlane document
```


By default, Jazzy creates a project docs folder for its documentation. As you can see, there's no "there" there yet. 
<!-- Open docs/index.html in browser -->
To fix this, I'll create a Jazzy configuration file.


## Configuration
To see what options are available, I'll run the following:
```
jazzy --help config
```
<!-- Scroll through results in Terminal -->


I'll create a very simple configuration file. 
I set myself as author, then redirect output to our project Documentation folder. 
Most importantly, I instruct Jazzy to include all files with internal accessibility level or higher (Jazzy's default is to documents only public declarations). 
```yaml
author: Brian Schick
output: ./Documentation
min_acl: internal
```

I save my file inside our project  `fastlane` directory as  `fastlane/jazzy.yaml`.   
By default, Jazzy will look in the project root for this file. So in Fastfile, I update my lane to address this:
```ruby
lane :document do
  jazzy config: "./fastlane/jazzy.yaml"
end
```
Now I'll run our lane again:
```
fastlane document
```


This time, my output is stored in `./fastlane/Documentation` folder as requested.  I can now see my main project classes and structs, then drill down to their methods and properties.
Our sample project hasn't done anything to prepare for documentation, so it's really nice to see as much information as exists here already. To resolve the persistent "Undocumented" messages at the top of each declaration, I need to go into my project and add documentation comments. 


I'll add a couple of simple documentation comments to my model:
<!-- 
In TrainingModel.swift, add

/// The root type for Chew Chew Training challenges
/// The specific challenges presented to Chew Chew Trainers. Make sure hints are funny (at least to you ;)

 Save then rerun fastlane document -->

I save my changes and rerun our lane.


When I review the Model documentation, our documentation comments display as expected. 
<!-- Show in browser -->

## Advanced Tuning
As you'd expect, there's a vast deal more you can do to tune Jazzy for your specific project needs. You can choose multiple themes, take full control over exactly what gets documented, and much more. The Jazzy Github repo is your best source for more info about this.


## Integrating with Production Lanes
I'll wrap things up by adding documentation to our `build_appstore` lane. I'll simply add a call to our `document` lane after our build and commit processes have completed:
```ruby
lane :build_appstore__git do
    sync_all_appstore
    ensure_git_status_clean
    ensure_bit_branch(branch: "staging")
    git_pull
    scan
    lint
	document
	…
    increment_build_number
    gym(
      scheme: "ChewChewTrain",
      output_directory: "build_AppStore",
      export_method: "app-store"
    )
    commit_version_bump(
      force: true,
      message: "Version bumped by fastlane"
    )
    add_git_tag(grouping: "fastlane")
    push_to_git_remote
  end
```
… and now every time anyone on my team does an App Store build, the project documentation will automatically update. I'd add my new `Documentation` folder to source control to ensure that updated documentation automatically up to date for everyone on my team.


# Conclusion
**[Slide 4]** 
Adding automatic project documentation puts the icing on the cake of our work so far in this final section. Our production lanes are becoming powerful indeed, and I think you can see how much additional value `fastlane` adds when you use it beyond the App Store ecosystem. 
In the next section, you'll see how to yet more power to your production lanes as we add by integrating automatic Slack notifications. See you there…
