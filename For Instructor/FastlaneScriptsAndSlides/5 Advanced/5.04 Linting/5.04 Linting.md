# Introduction
Now that we've integrated source control and unit testing into our lanes, a good next step would be to lint our code while we're at it.

## About Linters
If you're not familiar with code linting, it's a way to sift (or "lint") through a codebase and call out — and optionally auto correct — code that's not formatted to meet a standard. 
**[Slide 1]** 
Especially in team development environments, linting is often an essential tool at ensuring that everyone on the team uses the same coding conventions. This can lead to significant boosts in code quality and productivity. 
With linting, the devil's in the details: a linter enforces a configured set of rules, and if it's too strict, or you or your team haven't vetted these, the linter will just get in your way. Taking the time to tune a linter's rule can make the difference between a tool that smacks you upside the head or gently taps you on the shoulder. 
## SwiftLint
**[Slide 2]**
`fastlane` offers built-in support for `SwiftLint`, an open source linter created and  maintained by Realm. SwiftLint's main GitHub page is at [https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint][1]. 
**[Slide 3]** 
`SwiftLint's` rules are documented at [https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/blob/master/Rules.md][2], with extensive code examples for each. If you implement this yourself, this is a great resource.
**[Slide 4]** 
As usual, we'll integrate this tool into our automated workflows via a dedicated `fastlane` action — in this case, named… you guessed it… `swiftlint`.


# Demo
## Installing SwiftLint
To begin, we need to set up SwiftLint. Note that we won't be using fastlane yet in these initial steps. 
I'll install swiftlint using Homebrew:
```bash
brew install swiftlint
```
Next, I'll add a `.swiftlint.yml` file to our project root so we can customize our rules. 
```bash
code .swiftlint.yml
```
Like `fastlane` and homebrew, SwiftLint is written in Ruby, so its configuration file is written in YAML — a common format for Ruby configuration files. 
I'll just tell it which directories I want to check:
```bash
included:
  - ChewChewTrain
  - ChewChewTrainTests
```
With that done, I can now run `swiftlint` in the command line:
```bash
swiftlint
```
As you can see, it steps through through my project files and issues several warnings, giving me the file, line number, and relevant rule for each. It's not hugely useful yet, but that's a nice start.


## Fastlane
**[Slide ]** Swiftlint Documentation Page [https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/swiftlint/#swiftlint][3]
With SwiftLint up and funning, we're ready to plug it into fastlane. The matching `fastlane` action is named simply `swiftlint`. It can **only** be used in a lane, which makes sense in practice.
I'll create a new lint lane:


```ruby
  lane :lint do

  end
```
Then I'll configure `swiftlint`. I point it to our YAML config file and ask it to create a custom report. I set it to simply lint (that is, to report) errors and allow fastlane to continue if errors are detected:
```ruby
  lane :lint do
    swiftlint(
      mode: :lint,
      config_file: ".swiftlint.yml",
      output_file: "swiftlintOutput.txt",
      ignore_exit_status: false
    )
  end
```


I'll save my changes and run my lane:
```ruby
fastlane lint
```
Nothing spectacular, but the inline summary is improved, and the new output file will be useful. 
<!-- Show in Finder -->

Now I'll change `mode` from `:lint` to `:autocorrect`. Note that this is a symbol, not a string.
```ruby
mode: :autocorrect
```
I rerun my lane
```ruby
fastlane lint
```

This time, swiftlint has resolved most of my errors. Any remaining will be those that require human intervention.


This is a good time to tune our configuration file. 
```ruby
ll
code .swiftlint.yml
```
Let's say my team has decided we think lines longer than 120 chars are ok. In `.swiftlint.yml`, I have a couple of options:
I could set a different line length to enforce:
```ruby
line_length: 150
```
Or I could completely disable any line length checking:
```ruby
disabled_rules:
  - line_length
```


You can also add custom rules if you'd like. 
Whether to have your linter warn or go ahead and "fix" your code is a matter of personal and team choice. 
<!-- switch to Fastfile -->
I'm going to set my lane set to :autocorrect, because I'd like to enforce team standards. This will also encourage me to make sure my linter configuration fits my team's real world standards.


Our last task is to integrate linting into our production lane sets. Once again, because we've already set up our configuration files, this is almost trivial. 
I'll add this to my build lanes, placing it right after my unit tests:
```ruby
lane :build_appstore__git do
    sync_all_appstore
    ensure_git_status_clean
    ensure_bit_branch(branch: "staging")
    git_pull
    scan
    lint
    gym(
      scheme: "ChewChewTrain",
      output_directory: "build_AppStore",
      build_method: "app-store"
    )
    increment_build_number
    commit_version_bump(
      force: true,
      message: "Version bumped by fastlane"
    )
    add_git_tag(grouping: "fastlane")
    push_to_git_remote
  end
```
And that's all it takes to include linting in your core workflows.
It makes sense to lint at the same time I scan my app for potential App Store violations — After I've done a git pull, so I know I have the latest commits, and before I build. That way, if there are any serious linting issues, my lane will stop before moving on to the build stage.


# Conclusion
**[Slide 5]** 
Integrating linting into your `fastlane` workflow is easy to do. As you've seen, the main hurdles are agreeing on team standards and integrating these into project configurations, as `fastlane` integration itself is quite straightforward. And as with unit tests, if you're going to do it at all, it really does make sense to simply build it into your automation pipeline, so you can *know* it happens every time you build your project.
Up next: We'll add automated documentation to our `fastlane` workflows. See you in the next episode…
