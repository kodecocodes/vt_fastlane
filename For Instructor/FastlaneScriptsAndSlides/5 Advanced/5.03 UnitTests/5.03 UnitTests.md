# Introduction
In this episode, you'll learn how to automate your iOS Unit Tests, using the `fastlane` actions `scan`.
# Lecture
## The Case for Test Integration
**[Slide 1]** 
Unit testing is an essential part of iOS development, and Apple's `XCTest` framework makes it straightforward to create and maintain unit tests in our applications. But there's a potential meta weakness in conventional iOS unit testing, and that’s tests are often run ad hoc. And if have to manually remember and choose to test, when push comes to shove it's all too easy for testing to slip between the cracks. 
Now that you're using `fastlane` to automate your build processes, it makes perfect sense to integrate unit testing directly into your core lanes. This way, testing happens every time you build, and no matter which team member does this, they can't forget.
## Introducing Scan
**[Slide 2]** 
`scan` is fastlane's test automation action. It's very easy to use, and very powerful. And it follows the usual `fastlane` conventions you know.
**[Slide 3]**
Under the hood, `scan` uses `xcodebuild` and `xc_pretty`, an open source formatter for `xcodebuild`.  As you've seen earlier in this course, the command line syntax for running `xcodebuild` directly isn't pretty or easy to remember. Here's its code for running unit tests (points to slide). 
**[Slide 4]** 
Running scan, on the other hand, is exactly as simple as you'd expect:
# Demo
Let's take a closer look…
Before we can automate unit tests, we need tests to run. If you're not confident working with iOS unit tests, I highly recommend checking out our excellent [Testing in iOS][1] video course. Here, I've created a test target and schema, and I've created some very simple unit tests. I'll quickly run them manually to give you a quick look.
I can run these same tests with `scan`, simply by running:
```bash
fastlane scan
```
I'm prompted to select my test scheme, and then scan takes things from there, ultimately giving me a decent summary. Now I'll force a test to fail and repeat. This time, you'll see scan give me a nice callout of my failed method.
## Scanfile
Not too shabby, but we can do lots better. Unit testing is a repetitive task and you're likely to want to prompt them both from ad hoc CLI actions and lanes. So, it makes a lot of sense to have a common configuration file to provide default settings for both the command line and lanes. To create this file, run:
```bash
fastlane scan init
```
This creates a `Scanfile` in our project `fastlane` folder. 
<!-- open file in code editor -->
Let's add a few things. First, I'll remove the default content and enter our test scheme, so we never have to select this manually. I'll ask `scan` to clean my project before each run, and  to create and open an html report for me after each run. When I run this again…
```bash
fastlane scan
```
You'll see this time that I get a great html summary report, and my failing test stands out like a sore thumb just like it should. But wait, there's more! 
<!-- show in editor -->
`scan` has also created report file in JUnit format, an XML standard that can be integrated with a wide range of tools. Sweet!
## Adding to our Lanes
OK, let's add scan to our `Fastfile` now. Because I've set up my `Scanfile`, this will be really straightforward. 
I'm going to add scan to our two build lanes. 
I'll add this to our project `Fastfile` now. I'll create a simple lane to run my tests. I'll do this right after I've synced my team credentials. That way, if any of my tests fail, my lane will stop. My project build count won't increase, and the project won't build.
```ruby
   lane :build_appstore do
    sync_all_appstore
    scan
    increment_build_number
    gym( ... )
  end
```

```ruby
  lane :build_adhoc do
    sync_all_adhoc
    scan
    increment_build_number
    gym( ... )
  end
```
Note that by default, `scan` halts further lane progress… you don't have to do anything to get this (very desirable) behavior.
Like many `fastlane` tools, `scan` is deceptively simple to use — thanks to choosing sensible defaults — but has your back if you need to customize things. Check out its documentation for a ton of useful options. 
# Conclusion
**[Slide 5]** 
As you've seen, `scan` is a snap to set up and use. Integrating your unit tests directly into your core build processes makes all the sense in the world, and I highly recommend it. 
In the next episode, we'll see how to automate linting your Swift files. See you there…
